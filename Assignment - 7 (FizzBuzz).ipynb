    "# To improve your control flow statement skills and to raise your awareness of some arithmetic knowledge.\n",
    "# Write a Python code on any IDE, push it up to your GitHub repository and submit the GitHub page link address in addition to your code (answer) as a plain text.\n",

    "# Task : Print the FizzBuzz numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# FizzBuzz is a famous code challenge used in interviews to test basic programming skills. It's time to write your own implementation.\n",
    "# Print numbers from 1 to 100 inclusively following these instructions:\n",
    "# if a number is multiple of 3, print \"Fizz\" instead of this number,==>3,6,9,12,\"15\",18,21==>N%3==0 and N%15!=0\n",
    "# if a number is multiple of 5, print \"Buzz\" instead of this number,==>5,10,15,20===>N%5==0 and N%15!=0\n",
    "# for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print \"FizzBuzz\", ==>N%15==0\n",
    "# print the rest of the numbers unchanged.\n",
    "# Output each value on a separate line.\n",
    "# Note that : This question is famous on the web, so to get more benefit from this assignment, try to complete this task on your own.\n",
